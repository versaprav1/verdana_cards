# VerdantCards - Your AI-Powered Learning Partner

VerdantCards is an intelligent flashcard application designed to accelerate your learning process. It leverages the power of generative AI to automatically create study materials, offer personalized quizzes, and even generate video content to make learning faster, more effective, and more engaging.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Deck Creation**: Instantly generate flashcard decks from various sources:
  - **By Topic**: Simply provide a topic (e.g., "The Renaissance") and let the AI create a comprehensive deck.
  - **From PDF**: Upload a PDF of your lecture notes or textbook chapter, and the AI will extract key information to build your flashcards.
  - **From URL**: Provide a website link to an article or resource, and the AI will summarize it into a study deck.
- **Picture Decks**: For visual learners, generate flashcards that automatically include relevant images for each term.
- **Intelligent Study Sessions**: Uses a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) to show you cards at the perfect interval, maximizing long-term memory retention. You rate how well you knew a card, and the app schedules its next review accordingly.
- **Adaptive AI Quizzes**: Test your knowledge with multiple-choice quizzes that are generated on the fly. The AI can analyze your past quiz performance to focus on topics you find most challenging.
- **AI Study Buddy**: Engage in a conversation with a personal AI tutor for any of your decks. Ask questions, get simpler explanations, and deepen your understanding of the material.
- **AI Video Generation**: Create short, engaging video clips on any topic. You can even provide your existing decks as background context to guide the AI director, producing a video that is visually and thematically relevant to your studies.
- **Multi-Model Support**: You have the freedom to choose your preferred AI provider. The app supports:
  - Google AI (Gemini models)
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Ollama (for running local models like Llama 3)
- **Manual Control**: In addition to AI features, you have full control to create, edit, and delete decks and individual cards manually.
