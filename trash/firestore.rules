/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Flashcard App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Users can only
 * create, read, update, and delete data that belongs to them. This includes decks,
 * flashcards within those decks, and media assets.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership. Decks are stored
 * under /users/{userId}/decks/{deckId}, flashcards are stored under
 * /users/{userId}/decks/{deckId}/flashcards/{flashcardId}, and media assets are stored under
 * /users/{userId}/mediaAssets/{assetId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations require a verified user identity (request.auth != null).
 * - Data consistency between the path and document's internal fields is enforced on
 *   creation and updates to maintain the ownership model.
 * - All reads and writes are limited to the owning user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * No denormalization is used in this initial ruleset.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * All private data is stored under the /users/{userId} collection.
